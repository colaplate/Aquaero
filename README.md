# Aquaero - Interactive Art Experience
## Introduction
Aquaero is an interactive art experience that allows users to create creatures using their hands and other objects. Once these generated creatures have been made, they can be moved around by swiping across the table.

## About
The creatures interact with the environment through audio events triggered by the audience, such as bubbles or lightning strikes. Flocking creatures such as jellyfish, fish and birds can be found in levels and add to the interaction. Audio and Environments transition seamlessly as the characters move around.
